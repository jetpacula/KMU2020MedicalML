# KMU2020MedicalML
ML project for ITMO KMU 2020 Conference

Purpose of the code in the repository and the project istelf is to make use of the useless initial data (in this project's dataset- patient's city)

The aim of the algorithm - is to automatically determine whether the patient has the exact type of flu or the common cold.

Initially the dataset is structured with attributes as follows: age, gender, temperature when arriving on the checkup and the city of residence of the patient.

If we run the code on the dataset with and without the city of residence we will discover this attribute has no effect on the result of the test run.

However if we use the Integrated Ecological Wellness Index and substitute it for the City index in the dataset, the accuarcy of the test run increaces dramatically.

This project has been presented and is among winners at KMU Conference by ITMO university in 2020, use the code in this repository only for studying purposes only.
